\arguments{
\item{tagrelease.list}{A list, or an individual data.frame, of tag release data created by the \code{tag.release.data.preparation()} function.}

\item{tagrep.list}{A list, or an individual data.frame, of tag returns from the temporary_tag_returns file. The output from the FLR4MFCL function \code{read.temporary_tag_report()}.}

\item{fishery.map}{A data.frame that describes which fishery is fishing in which region and with which gear. The columns are: fishery_name, region, gear, fishery (the reference number), tag_recapture_group and tag_recapture_name. The map should contain entries for all fisheries to avoid data being inadvertently dropped.}

\item{names}{A vector of character strings naming the models for plotting purposes. If not supplied, model names will be taken from the names in the tagrelease.list (if available) or generated automatically.}

\item{recapture.groups}{A vector of the reference numbers of the tag recapture groups you want to plot.}

\item{plot.diff}{Do you want to plot the difference between the observed and predicted, or a time series of recaptures? TRUE (default) or FALSE.}

\item{scale.diff}{If TRUE, the difference between observed and predicted is scaled by the mean of observed returns.}

\item{show.legend}{Do you want to show the plot legend, TRUE (default) or FALSE.}

\item{show.points}{Do you want to show points as well as the smoother for the difference plots? Default is FALSE.}

\item{palette.func}{A function to determine the colours of the models. The default palette has the reference model in black. It is possible to determine your own palette function. Two functions currently exist: default.model.colours() and colourblind.model.colours().}

\item{save.dir}{Path to the directory where the outputs will be saved}

\item{save.name}{Name stem for the output, useful when saving many model outputs in the same directory}

\item{...}{Passes extra arguments to the palette function. Use the argument all.model.names to ensure consistency of model colours when plotting a subset of models.}
}
\description{
Plot the observed and predicted tag recaptures by tag recapture group.
Tags caught during the mixing period are not counted.
The plot is either a time series of the difference between the observed and predicted, or a time series of the recaptures.
A loess smoother is put through the differences.
